    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This pasta salad recipe is easy to make. Made with simple ingredients,
      this salad is flexible, so you can make this when you are inundated by
      summer produce or adapt to what is in season. Plus, you are looking at
      under 20 minutes from start to finish. Not too bad, especially when you
      can keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days!
